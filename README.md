# Rest Project + TypeScript

This previously initialized project has everything necessary to work with TypeScript, Express, and Rest.

Each step of its configuration has already been carried out earlier in the course, so it's only necessary to clone the project and start working.

## Installation:

1. Clone .env.template to .env and configure the environment variables.
2. Run npm install to install the dependencies.
3. If a database is needed, configure the docker-compose.yml and run docker-compose up -d to launch the desired services.
4. Fill database with seed `npm run seed`. 
5. Run npm run dev to launch the project in development mode.
